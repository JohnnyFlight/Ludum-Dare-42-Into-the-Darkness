# Ludum-Dare-42-Into-the-Darkness
Game made in Unity (C#) for Ludum Dare 42
Theme: Running out of Space

The Premise
You find yourself trapped in a cave, surrounded by an omnipresent darkness that threatens to overwhelm you if you get too close. Despite the vast size of the cave, you find yourself running out of space as you manage your dwindling amount of light as you try to keep the darkness at bay.

Thankfully you’re a pretty dab hand at making things, and there are some people above you providing support in the form of fuel at the start of each day. There are some shafts of light that offer you a brief reprieve from the darkness during the day, but when night falls you’re left to fend for yourself.

You mission, should you choose to accept it (not that you have a choice, unless you’d prefer to give up and die immediately) is to explore the ruins of the ancient civilization who used to live here, and build a mech so that you can escape, because that’s clearly the sensible thing to do.

Controls: 
- WASD to move
- Click a torch to add fuel
- I to toggle inventory

- Click an inventory item to drop / place it
- C to toggle crafting menu
- Click a recipe (if you can) to make that recipe
- E to manually gather resources (It’s broken in that you can mash to get lots)

Don’t go in the dark. Try to find the advanced gizmos to make a Mech to escape the cave!
